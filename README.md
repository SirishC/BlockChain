# NoobChain

This is a java Program to impliment  **BlockChain** .

## How it Works !
- The basic idea is to create a *Chain of Blocks*
    and each block is connect to the Previous block using the **HASH**
- The **HASH** is found using SHA-256 hashing.
- If someone tries to _modify_ any block the chain breaks and become invalid chain.
